# Conclusion
Basically, we wanted to develop a mobile App to track all record of DUET
Central Library by this project. And we tried to implement a librarian of DUET
Central Library full function on this mobile App. We use google firebase real
time database so from anywhere this information can be accessed.
Still there is some limitation of our project, that we will try to solve in next.
